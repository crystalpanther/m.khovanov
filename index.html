                    <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are
                        so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
                        that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
                        blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the
                        same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
                        and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
                        nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                        every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations o
                        f business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
                        man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures
                        to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
